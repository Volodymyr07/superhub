title: Download OCR URL
excerpt: >-
  Generate an OCR PDF by providing a document ID. This will add the OCR text
  into a layer on top of the PDF, allowing you to search the PDF by the OCR
  text. Returns a presigned URL to download the OCR PDF. This URL is valid for a
  limited time (e.g., 1 hour) and allows secure access to the OCR PDF stored on
  DocuPanda. Note that this endpoint only works for documents with PDF file
  types.
