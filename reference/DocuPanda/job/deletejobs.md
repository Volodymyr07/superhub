title: Delete Jobs
excerpt: >-
  Delete multiple jobs that have been submitted to DocuPanda for processing. You
  can provide a list of job IDs to delete multiple jobs at once. Since jobs are
  just a record of events, deleting them will just hide them from you - the
  actual records will still be stored in the database. For specific jobs that
  contain actual data, such as Analyze-Document, the data will be deleted.
