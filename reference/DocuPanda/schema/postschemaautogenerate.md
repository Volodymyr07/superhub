title: AutoGenerate a Schema
excerpt: >-
  Generate a schema based on a list of documents. Leave the instructions empty
  if you want the AI to use its best judgment, or provide instructions to
  indicate your preference to how the schema should be generated. Best results
  are achieved when you provide a varied list of documents that represent the
  full range of type of documents you expect to process, and when you provide
  clear instructions to what you expect the schema to capture and how you want
  it to be structured.
