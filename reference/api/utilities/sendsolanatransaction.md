title: Send Solana Transaction
excerpt: >-
  Use Coinflow's battle tested ⚔️ Transaction Sending (The same system we use to
  send our own transactions).


  This endpoint sends a fully signed Solana transaction with retries and stable
  RPC servers.

  This is helpful during periods of network instability where the solution is to
  use better private RPC servers,

  retry transactions multiple times.
